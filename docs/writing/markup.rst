:description: General markups and how it looks like on Shibuya Sphinx theme.

Markups
=======

This article is a demo of what the typography of Shibuya looks like.
You will learn the syntax of reStructuredText, and to see the rendered
result of each markup.

Emphasis
--------

Content can have inline markup like *emphasis*, **strong emphasis**,
and ``inline code``.

- ``*emphasis*`` is usually in an *italic* style
- ``**strong emphasis**`` is usually in a **bold** style

Inline code
-----------

An inline code is surrounded by double ``backticks``::

Links
-----

.. code-block:: ReST
  :caption: links
  :class: demo-code

  In Sphinx, link is called reference. There are many ways to create
  a reference. For instance :pep:`8` is generated by ``:pep:`8```. In
  general, it is just a link_.

Interpreted Text
----------------

Interpreted text is text that is meant to be related, indexed,
linked, summarized, or otherwise processed. It is usually used
together with a **role**:

.. code-block:: none

    :{role}:`interpreted text`

Subscript and Superscript
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :sub:`subscript` and :sup:`superscript` can be written with:

.. code-block:: ReST

   :sub:`text in subscript`

   :sup:`text in superscript`

- A subscript looks like :sub:`text in subscript`
- A superscript looks like :sup:`text in superscript`

Abbreviations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: ReST

  You can also include abbreviations like
  :abbr:`HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)`.

Keyboard
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: ReST

   :kbd:`Tab` means indent, :kbd:`Shift-Tab` means outdent.
   :kbd:`⌘+⇧+P` is power shortcuts in vscode.

Footnotes
---------

There are four ways to create a footnote item:

.. code-block:: none

   a whole decimal number consisting of one or more digits, like [1]_

   a single "#" will create auto-numbered footnotes [#]_

   a "#" followed by a simple reference name [#note]_

   a single "*"  will create auto-symbol footnotes [*]_

   .. [1] footnote for ``[1]``
   .. [#] footnote for ``[#]``
   .. [#note] footnote for ``[#note]``
   .. [*] footnote for ``[*]``


a whole decimal number consisting of one or more digits, like [1]_

a single "#" will create auto-numbered footnotes [#]_

a "#" followed by a simple reference name [#note]_

a single "*"  will create auto-symbol footnotes [*]_

Citations
---------

Citations are identical to footnotes except that they use only non-numeric
labels such as ``[note]`` or ``[GVR2001]``.

.. code-block:: ReST

   Here is a citation reference: [CIT2002]_.

   .. [CIT2002] This is the citation.  It's just like a footnote,
      except the label is textual.

Here is a citation reference: [CIT2002]_.

Reference

Footnotes
~~~~~~~~~

.. [1] footnote for ``[1]``
.. [#] footnote for ``[#]``
.. [#note] footnote for ``[#note]``
.. [*] footnote for ``[*]``
